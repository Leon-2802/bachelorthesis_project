## Project description
 
This project is part of my bachelor thesis "Conception and prototypical realisation of a semantic model for data processing in distributed data structures of public transport systems".

The project aims to visualize the use of semantic models in processing distributed data sources in public transport systems. 
In this particular case, the user shall be able to recieve all available data concerning the connection Mannheim Hauptbahnhof to Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof through the provided API-endpoint, without having to deal with sending queries to the APIs of the different transport providers operating on the route Mannheim-Karlsruhe.
